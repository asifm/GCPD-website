Corporate research and development plays a crucial role in pushing the frontier of technology; and, technological progress helps drive economic prosperity. By tracking corporate innovation, we can learn much about where and how new ideas, knowledge, products, and technologies are emerging. The dataset that we made available on this website provides a window into the world of corporate innovation across industries and geographies.

The public release of this dataset reflects our belief that it would open up new research possibilities and enable the discovery of insights in different areas of finance and economics. We also expect this data to help advance public discussion, outside of academia, on corporate innovation, productivity, and performance.
