<p class="uk-dropcap uk-text-large">Corporate research and development play a crucial role in pushing the frontier of technology. The progress of technology helps drive economic prosperity. By tracking corporate innovation, we can learn much about where and how new ideas, knowledge, products, and techniques are emerging.</p>

The dataset that we have made available on this website provides a window into the world of corporate patents—an important indicator of corporate research and development activities and the consequent innovation—across industries and countries.

The public release of this dataset reflects our belief that it would open up new research possibilities and enable the discovery of insights in different areas of finance and economics. We also expect this data to help advance public discussions, outside of academia, on corporate innovation, productivity, and performance.
