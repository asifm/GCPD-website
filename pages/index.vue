              p.fg-blue-fade-out-2.uk-dropcap.uk-text-large.uk-column-span Corporate innovation plays a crucial role in pushing the frontier of technology — and technology's progress helps advance economic prosperity. By tracking corporate innovation, we can learn much about where and how new ideas, knowledge, products and techniques are emerging.
              p.uk-margin-remove-top The new dataset available here provides a window into the world of corporate patents — an important indicator of corporate research and development activities and the consequent innovation—across industries and countries.
              p The public release of this dataset will hopefully open up new research possibilities and enable the discovery of insights in different areas of finance and economics. This data will also help advance public discussions, outside of academia, on corporate innovation, productivity and performance.
